__About this mod:__
-------------
This mod is inspired by "Nuclear Power" by Fatmice and "Uranium Power" by Simdezimon.
And, like the both, does this mod expand the production of nuclear fuel rods and the reprocessing of spent fuel rods.

This mod includes processing cycles for the following radioactive materials: __Uranium__, __Thorium__, __Neptunium__, __Plutonium__.
You also have to take care about some byproducts like: RaCoW (radioactive contaminated wastewater) ans solid radioaktive waste.

The enrichment process is slightly different from the vanilla one, you have to enrich yellowcake from uranium, step by step through gas centrifuges up to an enrichment value of 4.7% U235.

__Tested with vanilla factorio, with Bob's and/or Angel's and/or Earendel's mods. (See list below)__

__Future plans?__
-------------
- Since version 0.18.00 (Factorio 0.17.x) only bug fixing, balancing and compatibility layers for other mods.
- Since version 0.19.02 (Factorio 0.18.x) only bug fixing, balancing and compatibility layers for other mods.
__So it should be safe to take every update without running into a total messed up factory__

__Problems?__

At least the mods I have in my test chamber, should be compatible with more than this list.
