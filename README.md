# Amator Phasma's Mods

Amator Phasma's mods are a suite of mods for Factorio focused on energy and the early game. Originally, they were written and maintained by AmatorPhasma, who dropped off the grid sometime during the patch cycle of 0.18 as things were getting ready for release, citing general business and an inability to continue modding. The mods were converted over to be compatible with Factorio 1.0 and re-uploaded by nonnotmelon so that others could continue to enjoy them. Recon419A joined the team in October 2020. Currently, work is planned to bring the remainder into compatability with Factorio 1.0, as well as to integrate it better with Bob's and Angel's mods. If and when AmatorPhasma has time to get back to modding, we hope to merge the changes down to a common code set still licensed under GPL v3.

## Main Features

### Amator Phasma's Coal and Steam

Adds a burner power phase and a steam power phase at the beginning of the game, focusing on fuel types and successive improvements in fuel and burner technology and the development of steam-based machinery. Culminates in the discovery of electricity and neatly fits into the first part of the game before most other mods take effect.

### Amator Phasma's Nuclear

Adds depth and complexity to nuclear power, including processing chains for Uranium, Thorium, Neptunium, and Plutonium. Introduces cautious handling of radioactive materials and a new enrichment process.
