__About this mod:__
-------------
This mod revisits the early game of Factorio and pushes the electrification a bit further back by extending the Burner-Stage and inserting a new stage: Steam-Stage (buildings will be powered by steam).

"Love and fame for the burner inserter!"

The production lines of this mod focus on fuel production, but it also comes with a few new intermediates and a new science package. It does not change the standard Techtree too much, the majority of the related tech for this mod comes before the vanilla techtree even begins. The vanilla techtree and most of the other mods content are locked behind a new technology called "Electrification" which can be called the goal of this modification.

Tip: You should generate the map with a little more richness for coal, to not run out of it, since you need up to twice the amount of a normal vanilla playthrough.

#### The fuel is split in two different types: ####
- Unrefined fuel (like: raw coal and wood)
- Refined fuel (like: coke or charcoal briquettes)

*some machines or furnace can operate with unrefined fuel other need refined fuel

#### This mod comes with a few new buildings: ####
- Coking plant, Filter inserter, Long inserter, Puddling furnace, Improved mining drill (burner)
- Air cleaner, Steam mining drill, Sieve (steam powered)
- Steelworks (electric)
- Lab, Assmebling machine (burner, steam powered)
- Offshore-pumps (burner, electric)
- Crusher, Press, Centrifuge, Greenhouse (burner, steam powered, electric)
- Tier 2 Boiler and Steam engine

__Good to know:__
-------------
![](https://bjoern-trimborn.de/factorio/fuelchain.png)
Inserters can chain fuel through all types of burner machines.
Burner inserters can leach fuel from their pickup target and drop target.

![](https://bjoern-trimborn.de/factorio/fuel_tooltip.png)
You can see if a fuel item leaves residues after it is burned or used up.

![](https://bjoern-trimborn.de/factorio/entity_tooltip.png)
If a machine can run with multiple fuel type you can see this in the tooltip in a custom section, otherwise this custom section is not present and you can see the fuel type like in vanilla.

__Future plans?__
-------------
- Since version 0.18.00 (Factorio 0.17.x) only bug fixing, balancing and compatibility layers for other mods.
- Since version 0.19.02 (Factorio 0.18.x) only bug fixing, balancing and compatibility layers for other mods.
__So it should be safe to take every update without running into a total messed up factory__

__Known incompatibility:__
-------------
- Not compatible with the optional __"Burner power phase"__ setting from [Bob's Tech](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/bobtech).
- Not compatible with the optional __"Factory ingredient limits"__ setting from [Bob's Assembling machines](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/bobassembly).

__Known problem:__
-------------
- With [AAI Programmable Vehicles by Earendel](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/aai-programmable-vehicles) the burnt fuel inventory for all entities that uses the car prototype, does not work as expected, so you will lose any burnt results. (Working on it.)

-------------
__Tested compatibility__

At least the mods I have in my test chamber, should be compatible with more than this list.
